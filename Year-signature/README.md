# Key figures of a year
Demonstrates computations of "key figures" for a year:
* doomsday: the weekday that is common to fixed key days in the Milesian and Gregorian calendars;
* gold number: used for Easter computations;
* Milesian epact: mean moon age the day before (Milesian) new year:
  * Original Milesian epact, in half-days, but only in the range of years -5000 to 9000,
  * Milesian epact from Gergorian computus, i.e. Gregorian computus minus 11 (mod. 30);
* dates of solstices and equinoxes for the year;
* Easter (lunar) residue: number of days from 21 March (30 3m) to Easter full moon, after Roman computus;
* Easter offset: number of days from 21 March (30 3m) to Easter full moon;
* Dates of Julian and Gregorian Easter.
