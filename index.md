# The Milesian Calendar laboratory
The applications developped from the concept of Milesian calendar may be seen here. All files are grouped in this sub-repertory.
These applications use the calendrical-javascript package (see further).
The JSDoc documentation is constructed in the same directory.

## The complete Milesian clock
Read the real date and the time, convert from and to custom calendars, display custom and Unicode calendars get the mean moon's coordinates, the seasons, and the yearly main figures in Gregorian, Milesian and Julian calendars.

## Calendrical computations and Date object extension
This page demonstrates the functionnalities of ExtDate, ExtDateTimeFormat and custom calendars built with the Cycle Based Calendar Computation Engine - CBCCE.
