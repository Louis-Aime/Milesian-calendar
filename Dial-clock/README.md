# Milesian dial clock, or Milesian clock

A demonstrator of milesian date display on a dial that looks very much like the traditional hour display, 
except that the two hands display the month and the date, instead of the hour and the minutes.

## Installation
1. Extract MilesianDateProperties and CalendarCycleComputationEngine from JS-Date-properties into a directory of your computer. 
You may extract all, it does not matter. 
1. Extract all .js and .html files of Dial-clock into the same directory. 
1. Launch "LightMilesianClock" in our browser. 
This file is .svg file (if necessary you may change the postfix) that shows today's Milesian date. 
1. Launch "MilesianClock" in our browser. It shows today's Milesian date on the dial, and you may change the date.

## Notices
  * MS Internet Explorer does not work at all
  * Edge does not work, due to a a "getElementById" not finding the elements:
the DOM is not seen the same way in Edge
  * Software is tested under Firefox and Chrome
