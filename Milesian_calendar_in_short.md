# The Milesian calendar in short
The Milesian calendar is a solar calendar, with weighted months, in phase with seasons. 
It enables you to understand and take control of the Earth’s time.

The next picture represents the Milesian calendar with the *mean* solstices and equinoxes.

### Leap days
The leap day is the last day of Twelfthem, it is 31 12m or 12m 31 (whether you use British or American English). 
This day comes just *before* bissextile years.

### Years
The Milesian years are numbered as the Gregorian ones. However, they begin 10 or 11 days earlier.
1 Firstem Y (1 1m Y) corresponds to 21 December Y-1 when Y is a common year, like 2015. 
But it falls on 22 December Y-1 when Y is a leap year like 2016. 

The mapping between Milesian and Gregorian dates is shifted by one for 71 days during “bissextile winters”, 
that is from 31 Twelfthem to 9 Thirdem. 
10 Thirdem always falls on 1 March, and each following Milesian date falls always at a same Gregorian date.

### Date conversion - general rules
The first day of a Milesian month generally falls on 22 of the preceding Gregorian month, 
e.g.: 1 Fourthem (1 4m) falls on 22 March, 1 Fifthem (1 5m) on 22 April etc. 
However, 1 Tenthem (1 10m) falls on 21 Sept*ember*, 1 12m falls on 21 Nov*ember*; 
and 1 1m of year Y falls on 21 Dec*ember* Y-1 if Y is a common year, but on 22 December if Y is a leap year.
1 2m and 1 3m falls on 21 Jan*uary* and 21 Febr*uary* in leap years, 20 Jan*uary* and 20 Febr*uary* in common years.

The first day of a Gregorian month generally falls on 11 of the Milesian month of same rank, 
e.g. 1 April falls on 11 4m, 1 June falls on 11 6m. 
But 1 March, May and July fall on 10 3m, 5m, 7m respectively. 
Moreover, in leap years 1 January (1/1 for British) falls also on 11 1m, but 1 February (1/2) falls on 12 2m. 
And in common years you have to shift by one in January and February: 12 1m and 13 2m for 1 Jan and A Feb.

## Advantages
### Regular month interval
Each bimester within a year is exactly 61 days. This facilitate many mental computations. 
You can compute week of days within a year almost
