/* ISO 8601 week calendar properties added to Date object
Character set is UTF-8
This code, to be manually imported, set properties to object Date for the ISO week calendar, which is the calendar implied by ISO 8601.
Versions
	M2017-12-26 : replace CalendarCycleComputationEngine with CBCCE
	M2018-05-19 : set alias to getIsoWeekCalUTCDate (to be deprecated): getUTCIsoWeekCalDate
	M2018-10-26 : delete getIsoWeekCalUTCDate (deprecated)
	M2018-11-03 : set reference year to Gregorian year only, and improve toString presentations
	M2018-11-06	: manage display of out-of-range date
	M2018-11-11 : JSDocs comments
	M2018-11-16 : adapt to time zone computation
	M2019-06-12 : fix year setting for years 0 to 100
	M2019-07-27 : adapt to getRealTZmsOffset located in another package
	M2020-01-12 : strict mode
Required
	Package CBCCE.
	getRealTZmsOffset method.
Contents
	getIsoWeekCalDate : the day date as a three elements object: .year, .week, .date; .week is 1 to 53. Conversion is in local time.
	getUTCIsoWeekCalDate : same as above, in UTC time.
	setTimeFromIsoWeekCal (year, week, date, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) : set Time from ISO week calendar date + local hour.
	setUTCTimeFromIsoWeekCal (year, week, date, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) : same but from UTC time zone.
	toIsoWeekCalDateString : return a string with the date elements in IsoWeekCal: yyyy-Www-dd
	toUTCIsoWeekCalDateString : same as above, in UTC time zone.
