/* French revolutionary calendar properties added to Date object
Character set is UTF-8
This code, to be manually imported, set properties to object Date for the French Revolutionary calendar.
Versions 
	M2017-12-26
	M2018-05-19 : create getUTCFrenchRevDate, getFrenchRevUTCDate to be deprecated 
	M2018-10-26 : getFrenchRevUTCDate deprecated
	M2018-11-06	: manage display of out-of-range date
	M2018-11-11 : JSDocs comments
	M2018-11-16 : adapt to time zone computation
Required
	Package CBCCE.
Contents
	getFrenchRevDate : the day date as a three elements object: .year, .month, .date; .month is 0 to 11. Conversion is in local time.
	getUTCFrenchRevDate : same as above, in UTC time.
	setTimeFromFrenchRev (year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) : set Time from julian calendar date + local hour.
	setUTCTimeFromFrenchRev (year, month, date, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) : same but from UTC time zone.
	toIntlFrenchRevDateString : return a string with the date elements in Republican calendar: (day number) / (month number) / (year), month 1 to 12.
	toUTCIntlFrenchRevDateString : same as above, in UTC time zone.
