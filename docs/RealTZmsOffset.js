/* JS Date TZ Offset getter: get the effective Timezone offset in ms. 
Replaces Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset, which in certains cases yields an integer number of minutes whereas the real offset contains seconds.
	Character set is UTF-8
Versions
	M 2018-11-16
		The (only) function is added to UnicodeBasic.js 
	M2019-07-27
		Separate getRealTZmsOffset from UnicodeBasic, since this function has nothing to do with display routines.
	M2020-01-12
		Strict mode
Contents
	getRealTZmsOffset : the real time zone offset, in milliseconds, due to a bug in Chrome version of TZOffset.
Required
	Access to "Chronos" object.
