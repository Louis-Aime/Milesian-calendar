/* MilesianXMLLoad for application that use XML resources for the Milesian calendar.
	Charset: UTF-8
Former name: MilesianCommonSettings
Alternate way of constructing the names of the Milesian months
in various languages, by fetching an XML files possibly located on a remote server, 
rather than reading a long string.
This package is left for experimental purposes.
Versions 
	M2017-08-23: general algorithm
	M2018-05-21: adapted to new Milesian date formatter (methods added to Intl.DateTimeFormat)
	M2018-10-29: Comments updates, put console display in comments
	M2018-11-11: JSDoc Comments
Requires:
	Access to milesianMonthNames.XML on a suitable server
	CBCCE
	MilesianDateProperties
	UnicodeMilesianFormat.js (in order to issue a milesian date string)
Details about XML file access
	The XML dataset containing the Milesian names shall reside on a server that allows GET method,
	otherwise this JS script shall reside on the same domain than the XML file.
Instructions
	1.	A common HTML page shall call "initiateMilesianNames" passing the XML dataset resource as parameter.
		See "DateString_initiator.html" on GitHub as an example.
	2.	After initialisation:
		Common object milesianNames holds the names used in Milesian calendar, in LDML
		Status of milesianNamesRequest can be read
		All HMTL objects with "MilesianDateString" in their class attribute hold today's Milesian date string as textContent
		methods added to Intl.DateTimeFormat are able to compute any Milesian date string of any date and with any Locale and Option
