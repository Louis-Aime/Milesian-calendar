/* DOM XML load: load an external XML file into a DOM.
	Charset: UTF-8
A generalised way of creating a DOM from an XML file.
Built from milesianXMLLoad, formerly MilesianCommonSettings
This package is left for experimental purposes.
Requires:
	Access to milesianMonthNames.XML on a suitable server
	CBCCE
	MilesianDateProperties
	UnicodeMilesianFormat.js (in order to issue a milesian date string)
Details about XML file access
	The XML dataset shall reside on a server that allows GET method,
	otherwise this JS script shall reside on the same domain than the XML file.
Instructions
	1.	A common HTML page shall call "initiateMilesianNames" passing the XML dataset resource as parameter.
		See "DateString_initiator.html" on GitHub as an example.
	2.	After initialisation:
		Common object milesianNames holds the names used in Milesian calendar, in LDML
		Status of milesianNamesRequest can be read
		All HMTL objects with "MilesianDateString" in their class attribute hold today's Milesian date string as textContent
		methods added to Intl.DateTimeFormat are able to compute any Milesian date string of any date and with any Locale and Option
