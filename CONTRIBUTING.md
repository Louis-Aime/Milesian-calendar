## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Milesian calendar project.
It's people like you that make possible to change the world in depth.

### 1. What is all this about ?

May be you should first understand the Milesian calendar proposal. 
You can read [the Milesian calendar in short](/The Milesian calendar in short.pdf )
or, if you can read French, visit [http://www.calendriermilesien.org].

### 2. Where do I go from here?

The software pieces are aimed at working with a simple modern Internet browser,
locally or on a public site.
Try them by downloading one of the "demonstrators" together with the library packages needed:
* [Numeric Clock](Numeric-clock): use all JS-Date-properties and Milesian-Locale,
make calendar conversions, follow moon, anticipate possible eclipses. 
* [Year signature](Year-signature): get key yearly figures for weeks, moon, Easter date.
* [Milesian clock](Milesian dial clock): the milesian date of a year displayed like an hour in a day. 
Note that the Milesian clock does not work with MS Edge, due to a discrepancy in DOM support with Edge.

### 3. Bugs, comments and suggestions

### 4. I can help you !

I am new on GitHub, and maybe a little shy. That's why I ask you to make a small message before contributing:
[louis-aime@calendriermilesien.org], so that I can open rights.
So, if you have an idea, please tell me!

Expecting you learnt something interesting.
