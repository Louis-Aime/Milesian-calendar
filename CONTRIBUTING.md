## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Milesian calendar project.
It's people like you that make possible to change the world in depth.

### 1. What is all this about ?

May be you should first understand the Milesian calendar proposal. 
You can read [The Milesian calendar in short](https://github.com/Louis-Aime/Milesian-calendar/The Milesian calendar in short.pdf)
or, if you can read French or use a web site translator, visit [http://www.calendriermilesien.org].

### 2. Where do I go from here?

The software pieces are aimed at working with a simple modern Internet browser,
locally or on a public site.
Try them by downloading the latest version,
putting all files in the same directory, 
them launching any HTML file (see README files for latest details).

### 3. Bugs, comments and suggestions

If you have comments or suggestions, or if you want to report a bug, 
please [open an issue](https://github.com/Louis-Aime/Milesian-calendar/issues)
Please check whether an issue is already open.
Comments and suggestions are also possible from the main site [http://www.calendriermilesien.org]
or by writing directly to [louis-aime@calendriermilesien.org].

### 4. I can help you !

I am new on GitHub, and maybe a little shy. That's why I ask you to make a small message before contributing:
[louis-aime@calendriermilesien.org], so that I can open rights.
So, if you have an idea, please tell me!

Expecting you learnt something interesting.
