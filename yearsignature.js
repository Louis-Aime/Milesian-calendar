/* Year Signature of Julian, Gregorian and Milesian calendars
	Character set is UTF-8
	This set of functions, to be manually imported, computes year key figures.
Required
	Chronos
	(the Milesian calendar, as a reckoning system, is not required)
Each function returns a compound value with the yearly key figures for one calendar:
	julianSignature: for the Julian calendar,
	gregorianSignature: for the Gregorian calendar,
	milesianSignature: for the Milesian calendar.
Key figure include:
	doomsday : the weekday number of "0th March" or "0th 1m", see this information on this method by John Conway.
	easterResidue: number of days from 21st March (30th 3m for Milesian) to the computus Spring full moon.
	eaterOffset: number of days from 21st March (30th 3m) to Easter Sunday.
	epact: Julian / Gregorian computus epact, Milesian mean moon epact.
*/
/* Version M2021-02-15	Use as module, with calendrical-javascript modules
	M2020-12-29 
		Use Chronos.mod
		Derive Milesian signature from Gregorian figures, no more half-integer epact.
	M2020-01-12 : strict mode
	M2019-10-10: Reduced milesian epact is never 29.5, but rather 0.0
	M2019-07-27: Update dependencies, no new code
	M2019-06-28: Enhance Milesian epact computation, shall depend on UTC time only.
	M2019-05-12: Add the the milesiancomputusepact i.e. epact of the gregorian computus one day before 1 1m (not to be recommended)
	M2019-01-13: Milesian intercalation is same as Gregorian
	M2018-11-13: JSDoc comments
	M2018-10-26: enhance comments
	M2017-12-26
	M2017-06-04
